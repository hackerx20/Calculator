# Simple GUI Calculator

## Introduction

A simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) calculator built using Python and the Tkinter library. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
Key features includes:
* Supports basic arithematic operations
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
* Clear button to reset the calculator
* keyboard shortcut support
* User friendly interface.


## Installation

To install the simple GUI calculator, follow these steps:

Step 1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hackerx20/Calculator.git
   ```
Step 2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd Calculator
   ``` 
Step 3. Install dependencies:
The calculator is built using Python's Tkinter, which is included in standard Python distributions. Make sure Python is installed on your system (version 3.x is recommended).
You can check if Python is installed by running:
```bash
python3 --version
```
Or 
```bash
python --version
```
### If python is not installed->
#### If you are running in windows system:
  >> Download Latest version of python from the Internet

#### If you are running in linux system:
> For Debian-based System (Ubuntu, Mint and other related distributions):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```  

> For Arch-based Distributions:
```bash
sudo pacman -S tk
```
After installation, you can verify that Tkinter is available by running a Python shell and trying to import the module:

```bash
python3
```
Then in the python shell:
```bash
import tkinter
```

Step 4: Now run the Calculator.py code by using the following command:
```bash
python3 Calculator.py
```

## Usage
1. Launch the calculator by running the script:
   ```bash
   python3 Calculator.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python Calculator.py
   ```
2. The calculator will open a GUI window. You can click the buttons to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Use the Clear button or the Backspace key in the keyboard to clear the current input.

## Technologies:

A list of technologies used in the project:
* Python 3.x: The programming language used to build the logic of the calculator.
* Tkinter: Python's built-in library for creating GUI applications.
